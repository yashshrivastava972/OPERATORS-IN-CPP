Aim: Find positive and negative number.

Tool: VS CODE.

Theory: This program is used to check whether a given number is positive, negative, or zero using conditional statements in C++.

Key Concepts Used:

1. Input:
The user is asked to enter an integer.
cin >> number; stores this value in the number variable.

2. Decision Making (if-else if-else):
if (number > 0) → The number is positive.
else if (number < 0) → The number is negative.
else → The number is zero.

3. Output:
The result is displayed using cout.

Conclusion:
This program demonstrates the use of:
1. if-else conditional statements
2. User input and output
3. Basic number classification logic

It is a simple and effective way to understand decision-making in C++ and forms the foundation for writing logic-based programs.
